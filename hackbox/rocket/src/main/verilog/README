in order for your verilog to be synthesized into the ROCC,
it needs to have the following conditions:
1) n inputs, one output.
2) all ports are 64 bits wide
3) the circuit is purely combinational (clk on next iteration, or add it to Top.HackBoxFPGAConfig.v before bitstream synthesis with Vivado)
4) the names of the ports should be declared as follows:
	
module <module name>(
	input [63: 0] in_0,
	input [63: 0] in_1, 
	...
	output [63: 0] out
	);
...
endmodule

After your verilog is according to these rules and is in this folder,
proceed to ../python/ and follow the README
